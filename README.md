### Welcome to my github page

:computer: My first name is Edouard, and I am 41 years old and I have been developing since the end of 2019. I discovered the world of code by creating an online store on Shopify when I wanted to modify one of their free templates. I fell on lines of code and I wanted to be one of those who can read them.

:trophy: After having followed several courses on OpenClassrooms, I chose to join the android application developer diploma course. I graduated in November 2021. Currently you will find the principal projects that I realized during my training at OpenClassrooms.

:loudspeaker: Graduate android application developer specialized in java, I am actively looking for a work-study contract (in an apprenticeship or professionalization contract) in Bordeaux and its surroundings to continue my skills development and become an Application Designer Developer (Bac +4).
The rhythm of the alternation is 3 weeks in companies and 1 week in training for a period of 17 months. The courses are given by Simplon.co at the digital city of Bègles from November 21, 2022 to May 25, 2024. The work-study contract begins on January 2, 2023.
Rigorous, autonomous and eager to progress, don’t hesitate to contact me if my profile interests you.
